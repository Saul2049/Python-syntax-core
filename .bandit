# Bandit configuration for trading framework
# Skip some tests that are acceptable in trading context

# Skip tests for:
# B101: assert_used - asserts are OK in trading logic
# B311: random - pseudo-random is OK for non-security purposes like jitter
# B324: hashlib_new_insecure_functions - MD5 OK for non-security hashing
# B601: paramiko_calls - if we use paramiko for deployment
# B602: subprocess_popen_with_shell_equals_true - controlled shell usage
# B603: subprocess_without_shell_equals_true - controlled subprocess usage
# B607: start_process_with_partial_path - controlled process starting
